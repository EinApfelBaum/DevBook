# Switching to fish

If you wish to use fish as your default shell, use the following command:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

`chsh` will prompt you for your password and change your default shell. (Substitute /usr/local/bin/fish with whatever path fish was installed to, if it differs.) 
Log out, then log in again for the changes to take effect.

Use the following command if fish isnâ€™t already added to /etc/shells to permit fish to be your login shell:

```bash
echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
```

To switch your default shell back, you can run `chsh -s /bin/bash` (substituting /bin/bash with /bin/tcsh or /bin/zsh as appropriate).
